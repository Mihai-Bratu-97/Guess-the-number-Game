# Description

This is a simple game where you have to guess a number that computer plays(was made it with some basic graphics interface, because I didn't want to let it running in terminal). 

Was made it in Python programming language. 

More of this game you will see during the game.

# Tech
-tkinter library(which is a library for basic graphic interface)

-numpy library(which is a library more for Data analyst, but I used a piece of data analyst for doing something)

-random library(for generating some things randomly)

-csv library(comma separated values, which I used it for storing information)

-os-sys library(for checking if a file is empty or not)
